# Formal proof of Linear Sieve in Lean 4

This repository contains a Lean 4 proof demonstrating that a linear sieve (often referred to as the “Euler sieve”) correctly generates:
1. the list of primes between 2 and 𝑛.
2. the least factor function between 2 and 𝑛.

Running the Code
To try out the code:
You can just simply copy the code into https://live.lean-lang.org/.

Important Note
At the end of the file, I only proved the sieve’s correctness, I did not prove that the algorithm runs in linear time—only.
